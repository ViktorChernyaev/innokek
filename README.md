# Task

1) Implement an array generator of length k (1000 by default) elements. Elements of this array are objects, property names are taken from an array of specified strings, values are created from random strings. [PR](https://github.com/ViktorChernyaev/react-test-task/pull/1)
2) Implement a mechanism for outputting data to the list in any convenient way. Implement a filter by property name and value for working with an array from the first task. The result of the filter operation should be an array whose elements have a match with the specified filtering string. [PR](https://github.com/ViktorChernyaev/react-test-task/pull/2)
3) On a separate page, implement the list with the CRUD operations, filter by keys-values, and sort by the key. [PR](https://github.com/ViktorChernyaev/react-test-task/pull/3)
